### Initial Learning and Setup
We began by reading and discussing the paper.  Once we felt comfortable with our understanding of mPy, Sketch, and the automatic feedback system, we moved on to downloading Sketch for ourselves. We ran into a few errors, so it took awhile, but eventually, after posting to Piazza and receiving some help, we both had Sketch running. We examined the included test cases, glanced through The Sketch Programmerâ€™s Manual, and then decided to implement the derivative program included in the paper and pass it to the solver.
